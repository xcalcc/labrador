Xcalibyte Standard Compliance Analyzer (XSCA) Architecture
--------

Rules can be implemented in 3 categories:
- Preprocessor (lexer) rules
- Parser tree (TBD, seems invalid) rules
- AST rules

For AST rules, there are also 3 kinds:
- For Decl, like VarDecl, FunctionDecl, TypeDecl, etc
- For Stmt/Expr, like IfStmt, BinaryExpr, etc
- For Type, like EnumType, RecordType, etc

For each manager:
- Manages the callbacks which is called by Lex (PPCallbacks) or Sema (ASTConsumer)
- Manages the rules belongs to this category
